Sparc
===

The first open-source Arma 3/DayZ RCon utility ever created. Bundled with powerful and easy-to-use features.

Key Features
===
- Save your favorite servers and quickly connect to them.
- Connect to **multiple servers simultaneously** through Sparc's server tab system!
- Easy and intuitive lists showing player-, ban- and admins list with a search filter on multiple columns.
- Players are automatically added and removed from the player list upon [dis]connect, no need to refresh.
- Three tabs (All, Chat, Console) to keep track of everything that is happening on the server.
- These three tabs can also be logged to text files and will then be timestamped and appended with the hostname.
- Each chat type is portrayed in a different color so they can be easily distinguished.
- Self-explanatory "Settings" page with extra information displayed on hover.
- Flash the Sparc window either when an admin or your name is called!
